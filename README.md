# Explainers

In the first phase of the Community Group's exporation, we aligned on the issues and challenged related to the use of WebViews.
The issues submitted by the community can be found [here](https://github.com/WebView-CG/usage-and-challenges/issues?q=is%3Aissue),
and the final report can be found [here](https://webview-cg.github.io/usage-and-challenges/).

Now, the goal of the Community Group is to work on solutions for the problems we have aligned on, in the form of technical explainers that
will be hosted in this repo, and discussed in the CG syncs.

If you would like to add an explainer, create an issue using the explainer [template](https://github.com/WebView-CG/explainers/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/explainer-template.md) (based on the WICG explainer template).
